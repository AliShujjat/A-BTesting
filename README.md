# ABTesting

This repository practices the use of A/B Testing for an e-commerce website. The idea is based on the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree.

Some questions I shall be answering are 

- What is the probability of an individual converting regardless of the page they receive?
- Given that an individual was in the control group, what is the probability they converted?
- Given that an individual was in the treatment group, what is the probability they converted?

And then also perform the A/B Test on the dataset 


The dataset that I shall be using can be found [here.](https://www.kaggle.com/zhangluyuan/ab-testing)
